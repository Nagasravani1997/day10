  <h2>css</h2>
  <p><b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b> is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
  <h2>Style sheet</h2>
  <p id="el3">Style sheet (web development)
    A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors, and a declaration block.</p>
  <h2>Selector</h2>
  
    <p id="el1">"CSS class" redirects here. For non-CSS use of element classes in HTML, see class attribute (HTML).
      In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.</p>
  
 <h2>Selector types</h2>
 <div id="el4">
  <p>
    Selectors may apply to the following:<br>
    <ul style="color:blue">
        <li> all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2</li>
        <li>elements specified by attribute, in particular:<br></li>
        <li>    id: an identifier unique within the document, denoted in the selector language by a hash prefix e.g. #id<br>   
        </li>
        <li> class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document, denoted by a dot prefix e.g. .classname (the phrase "CSS class", although sometimes used, is a misnomer, as element classes—specified with the HTML class attribute—is a markup feature that is distinct from browsers' CSS subsystem and the related W3C/WHATWG standards work on document styles; see RDF and microformats for the origins of the "class" system of the Web content model)</li>
        <li>    elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree.<br>
        </li>
        <li>    Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. A class may apply to any number of instances of any element. An ID may only be applied to a single element.
        </li>
      </p>

 </div>
  
    </ul>
